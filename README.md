📡 UART Design and Verification using SystemVerilog
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and functional verification of a Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) protocol using SystemVerilog. The goal is to verify the correct transmission and reception of serial data using a constrained-random testbench and assertions.

It is developed and simulated on EDA Playground, an online simulation environment for SystemVerilog and UVM-based testbenches.

🎯 Objectives
Design a synthesizable UART module (TX and RX)

Create a testbench for functional verification using SystemVerilog

Use assertions to check protocol correctness

Analyze simulation waveforms and debug errors

⚙️ Tools and Languages
Language: SystemVerilog
